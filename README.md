# Capacitive Theremin
 This is a simple Capacitive Theremin I built using an Arduino Uno and tin foil to adjust the sound being played dynamically based on the varying flow of electrons eminating from the player's hand. The closer the player's hand is to the tin foil, the higher the pitch of the sound.
